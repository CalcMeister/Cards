The outcome of games can be classified as one of n possible outcomes.
Simulations across all starting decks will converge outcome probabilities for each of these states.

In a perfectly skill-based game, these probabilities will not be affected by only simulating particular initial deck state.
In a perfectly luck-based game, only one outcome state will occur when simulating games from a particular initial deck state.

Most games fall somewhere in the middle.

The objective is to create a metric that can empirically quantify the skill-based-ness of a game by looking at the probabilities of possible end states as initial decks change.
This metric must be independent of the number of possible end states and the mean probabilities of them occurring.
